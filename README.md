MQTT Garage Controller 

This project is an ESP32 based garage controller that reports and controls the status of a garage door via an MQTT server.  The AS5600 senses the rotation of the motor and will need to be calibrated for the correct number of rotations for your specific door.  A small diametric magnet will also need to be glued to the center of the exposed portion of the motor shaft or gear to sense this rotation.
